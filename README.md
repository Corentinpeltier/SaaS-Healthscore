# SaaS-Healthscore
Trying to create a viable healthscore without any advanced technique or machine learning !

To do so, we collected the usage datas of ~80 users (10 churners, 70 non-churners) on 12 features over two months. Our main objective is to distinguish churners from non-churners.

For the churners, we take the datas two months before the churn date, for the non-churners we try to take datas from the approximative same time period.
